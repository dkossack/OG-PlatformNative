Analytics	Demonstrates the full use of the system for performing calculations by creating a security, a suitable view, a market data snapshot from the view, and then executing the view with peturbations on the market data snapshot.
Analytics2	Demonstrates the full use of the system for performing calculations by creating a security, a suitable view, a market data snapshot from the view, and then executing the view with peturbations on the security.
Curves	Demonstrates specifying curve names at the position level.
FXPriceAndGreeks	Demonstrates constructing a portfolio containing securities with different properties (in this case FX Options with a range of strikes) to show how a single OpenGamma engine cycle can then be used to calculate everything in parallel.
Historical	Iterates a view over historical market data to produce timeseries for the portfolio. This demonstrates the functions used to perform the historical iteration; the choice of view and handling the data is arbitrary.
MarketDataSnapshot	Demonstrates manipulating a market data snapshot programmatically.
Perturbed	Iterates a view over some historical market data that is perturbed slightly. This demonstrates injecting values into the engine.
SwapExample	Demonstrates constructing a swap security, specifying all of the market data required and pricing it using the engine.
TimeSeries	Loads a time-series from the database using a ticker
View	Select one or more views to run; this might be a wild-card search string like "*" to run all views (not currently supported in OG-Language). Leaving blank will iterate over all views.
YieldCurve	Loads the time-series for yield curve data points to construct a 3D "curve over time" graph.
YieldCurve2	Iterates a view over historical data, extracting the fitted curve from each cycle to produce a dataset for a 3D "fitted curve over time" chart. This uses the code within the main OpenGamma engine and analytics library compared to YieldCurve.R which simply fetches the raw time-series used to construct the curve.
