The 'fromFudgeMsg' functions should seldom need to be called directly unless fields are being manually extracted from Fudge representations of analytic or OpenGamma system objects. The accessor methods provided for the class wrappers will automatically apply the conversions and return structured R object. Alternatively, if the Fudge message contains type information the 'toObject.FudgeMsg' function can be used to select the correct conversion function.
